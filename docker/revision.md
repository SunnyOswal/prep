+ Containerization is the process of encapsulating software code along with all of its dependencies inside a single package so that it can be run consistently anywhere.
+ Docker is an open source containerization platform. It provides the ability to run applications in an isolated environment known as a container.
+ Containers are like very lightweight virtual machines that can run directly on our host operating system's kernel without the need of a hypervisor.
+ A program known as a hypervisor creates and runs virtual machines. The physical computer running a hypervisor is called the host system, while the virtual machines are called guest systems.
+ The hypervisor treats resources — like the CPU, memory, and storage — as a pool that can be easily reallocated between the existing guest virtual machines.
+ Hypervisors are of two types:

    + Type 1 Hypervisor (VMware vSphere, KVM, Microsoft Hyper-V).
    + Type 2 Hypervisor (Oracle VM VirtualBox, VMware Workstation Pro/VMware Fusion).
