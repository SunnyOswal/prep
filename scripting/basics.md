# Best Practices in Bash
+ **Check preconditions first, and fail if they aren’t met**
  + if we put the precondition checks before any execution, and fail the script immediately if the preconditions aren’t met, then script execution can’t fail half-way through doing work. 
+ **Try not to nest error checks**
