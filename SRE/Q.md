# Availability vs Reliability
+ **Availability**: percentage of time that the infrastructure, system or a solution remains operational under normal circumstances in order to serve its intended purpose.  
    + The measurement of Availability is driven by time loss
    + **Percentage of availability** = (total elapsed time â€“ sum of downtime)/total elapsed time
+ **Reliability**:
probability that the system will meet certain performance standards in yielding correct output for a desired time duration.  
    + The measurement of Reliability is driven by the frequency and impact of failures.
